# react-java-app

Hey!

I used Java 18 and ReactJS for this application.

After downloading the package you need to get a Gradle Build. 
Then you can run the "TaskAppApplication" spring boot project. 

For react part go to webapp folder
```
cd /src/main/webapp
```

Then you need to install packages and dependencies, so run yarn or npm command for it.

I used yarn, just saying ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```
yarn install
npm install
```

Then you need to run Java and React app at the same time. For Java just run the spring boot project.
For react use one of these commands

```
yarn start
npm start
```

## Project Structure

For Java, i created controller, model, repository, service and util folders; 
they have their classes for their jobs : managing tasks.
